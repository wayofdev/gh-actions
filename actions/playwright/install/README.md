# Playwright / Install

This GitHub Action installs [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) along with its dependencies. Playwright is a framework for browser-based automation and testing across multiple browsers. This action supports custom configurations for cache directories and the installation of specific browsers, tailored for efficient testing environments in CI workflows.

<br>

## Example Usage

Create a new workflow file, for example, `.github/workflows/test.yml`, and add the following code to it.

```yaml
---

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

name: ðŸ§ª E2E testing for web app

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: ðŸ“¦ Check out the codebase
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # ...

      - name: ðŸŽ­ Install Playwright
        uses: wayofdev/gh-actions/actions/playwright/install@master
        with:
          playwright-cache-folder: '~/.cache/ms-playwright'
          cache-prefix: 'ci-tests'
          browsers: 'chromium webkit'

      # ...

...
```

For details, see [`actions/playwright/install/action.yml`](https://chat.openai.com/c/action.yml).

Real-world examples can be found in the [`wayofdev/next-starter-tpl`](https://github.com/wayofdev/next-starter-tpl/blob/master/.github/workflows/e2e-apps-web.yml) repository.

## Structure

### Inputs

- `playwright-cache-folder`, optional: Specifies the directory for caching Playwright installations. Defaults to `~/.cache/ms-playwright`.
- `cache-prefix`, optional: A prefix used to invalidate the cache in case of issues. Defaults to `default`.
- `browsers`, optional: Specifies which browsers to install. Defaults to `"chromium webkit"`.

### Outputs

none

### Side Effects

- Custom configurations are used to set up the Playwright environment, specifically targeting cache management and browser installation.
- The caching mechanism is optimized with a dynamically generated cache key that considers the OS, Playwright version, browser selection, and any specified cache prefix.
- If the cache does not match the current requirements (e.g., due to a version update or change in selected browsers), Playwright will reinstall the necessary components.
